# Admin Password Change Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds secure admin password change functionality to the FIST Content Moderation System. The key security improvements include:

1. **Database-stored admin credentials** with secure password hashing
2. **Admin-only password change** capability (admins cannot change user passwords)
3. **Secure password hashing** using bcrypt via passlib
4. **Current password verification** before allowing changes
5. **Backward compatibility** with config-based authentication

## Key Features

### âœ… Security Requirements Met

- **Admin password change**: âœ… Admins can change their own password through the web interface
- **No user password change**: âœ… Removed admin ability to change user passwords for security
- **Secure hashing**: âœ… All passwords stored using bcrypt (more secure than SHA-256 for passwords)
- **Current password verification**: âœ… Must provide current password to change it
- **Database storage**: âœ… Admin credentials stored securely in database

### ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

#### 1. Database Schema
- **New `admins` table** with secure password storage
- **Admin model** with username, password_hash, timestamps, and active status
- **Database operations** for admin credential management

#### 2. Authentication System
- **Hybrid authentication** supporting both database and config-based credentials
- **Secure password verification** using bcrypt
- **Backward compatibility** for existing deployments

#### 3. Web Interface
- **Admin password change form** in the users management page
- **Removed user password change** buttons and functionality
- **Confirmation prompts** for security
- **Input validation** (minimum 6 characters)

#### 4. Migration System
- **Automatic migration script** (`migrate_admin.py`) to move config credentials to database
- **Safe migration** that doesn't overwrite existing database credentials

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `models.py` - Added Admin database model
- `database.py` - Added admin management operations
- `auth.py` - Added database-based admin authentication
- `admin_routes.py` - Updated login logic and password change functionality

### Templates
- `templates/users.html` - Added admin password change form, removed user password change

### New Files
- `migrate_admin.py` - Database migration script
- `test_admin_password.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Migration (One-time setup)
```bash
python migrate_admin.py
```

### 2. Admin Password Change
1. Login to admin panel at `/admin`
2. Navigate to "Users" page
3. Find "Change Admin Password" section
4. Enter current password and new password
5. Click "Change Password"

### 3. Security Notes
- **Minimum password length**: 6 characters
- **Current password required**: Must verify current password before change
- **Secure storage**: Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- **No user password access**: Admins cannot change user passwords

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python test_admin_password.py
```

Tests verify:
- âœ… Current admin credentials work
- âœ… Wrong passwords are rejected
- âœ… Password change functionality works
- âœ… Old passwords stop working after change
- âœ… New passwords work after change
- âœ… Web interface is accessible

## Security Considerations

### Password Hashing
- Uses **bcrypt** via passlib (industry standard for password hashing)
- **Salt included** automatically by bcrypt
- **Computationally expensive** to prevent brute force attacks

### Authentication Flow
1. **Database first**: Check database credentials
2. **Config fallback**: Support legacy config-based auth
3. **Secure verification**: Use constant-time comparison

### Access Control
- **Admin-only**: Only admins can change admin passwords
- **Self-service**: Admins can only change their own password
- **No user access**: Removed admin ability to change user passwords

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility:
- **Config authentication** still works for existing deployments
- **Gradual migration** - database credentials take precedence when available
- **No breaking changes** to existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for production:
1. **Password complexity requirements** (uppercase, numbers, symbols)
2. **Password history** to prevent reuse
3. **Account lockout** after failed attempts
4. **Two-factor authentication** for additional security
5. **Password expiration** policies
6. **Audit logging** for password changes

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a secure, user-friendly admin password change system that follows security best practices while maintaining backward compatibility. The system is thoroughly tested and ready for production use.
